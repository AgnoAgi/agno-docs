## Simple, Fast, and Agnostic

Agno is designed with three core principles:

- **Simplicity**: No graphs, chains, or convoluted patterns â€” just pure python.
- **Uncompromising Performance**: Blazing fast agents with a minimal memory footprint.
- **Truly Agnostic**: Any model, any provider, any modality. Future-proof agents.

## Key features

Here's why you should build Agno Agents:

- **Lightning Fast**: Agent creation is 6000x faster than LangGraph ([performance](#performance)).
- **Model Agnostic**: Use any model, any provider, no lock-in.
- **Multi-Modal**: Native support for text, image, audio, and video.
- **Multi-Agent**: Delegate tasks across a team of specialized agents.
- **Memory Management**: Store user sessions and agent context in a database.
- **Knowledge Stores**: Use vector databases for Agentic RAG or dynamic few-shot.
- **Structured Outputs**: Make Agents respond with structured data.
- **Monitoring**: Track agent sessions and performance in real-time on [agno.com](https://app.agno.com).
