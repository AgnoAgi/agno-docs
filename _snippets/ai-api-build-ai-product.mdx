## Optional: Build your AI Product

The `ai-api` comes pre-configured with common endpoints that can be used to build your AI product. The general workflow is:

- Your front-end/product will call the `ai-api` to create Agent runs.
- Using the `run_id`, your product with serve chats to its users.

The `ai-api` endpoints are developed in close collaboration with real AI Apps and are a great starting point to build on. For example:

- Call the `/assitants/create` endpoint to create a new run for a user.

```json
{
  "user_id": "my-app-user-1",
  "agent": "AUTO_PDF"
}
```

- The response contains a `run_id` that can be used to build a chat interface by calling the `/assitants/chat` endpoint.

```json
{
  "message": "how do I make pasta",
  "stream": true,
  "run_id": "bef092a7-707c-43a4-902c-9fa7fdfa5ff2",
  "user_id": "my-app-user-1",
  "agent": "AUTO_PDF"
}
```

These routes are defined the `api/routes` folder and can be customized to your use case.
