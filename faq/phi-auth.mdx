If you run `ag auth` and you get the error: `CLI authentication failed` or your CLI gets stuck on

```
Waiting for a response from browser...
```

It means that your CLI was not able to authenticate with your Agno account on [agno.app](https://agno.app)

The quickest fix for this is to export your `PHI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
export PHI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

Your API key can be found on [agno.app](https://agno.app) in the sidebar under `API Key`.

Reason for CLI authentication failure:

- Some browsers like Safari and Brave block connection to the localhost domain. Browsers like Chrome work great with `ag auth`.
