sidebarTitle: OpenAI Key Request for Other Models
---

If you see a request for an OpenAI API key but haven't explicitly configured OpenAI, it's because Agno uses OpenAI models by default in several places, including:

- **Agent execution**
- **Memory summaries and retrieval**
- **Embedders and rerankers**

Since OpenAI is the default model provider, any function requiring an LLM, embedding model, or reranker will attempt to use OpenAI unless explicitly configured otherwise.

## Quick fix: Configure a Different Model

If you want to use a different provider, update your agent or model configuration.

For example, to use Anthropic instead of OpenAI:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"),
    description="Your are an intelligent research assistant that analyzes research trends",
    markdown=True
)
agent.print_response("Tell me about AI research trends.", stream=True)
```
