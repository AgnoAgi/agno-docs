sidebarTitle: OpenAI Key Request While Using Other Models
---

If you see a request for an OpenAI API key but haven't explicitly configured OpenAI, it's because Agno uses OpenAI models by default in several places, including:

- The default model when unspecified in `Agent`
- The default embedder is OpenAIEmbedder with VectorDBs, unless specified


## Quick fix: Configure a Different Model

If you want to use a different provider, update your agent or model configuration.

For example, to use Anthropic instead of OpenAI:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"),
    description="Your are an intelligent research assistant that analyzes research trends",
    markdown=True
)
agent.print_response("Tell me about AI research trends.", stream=True)
```
