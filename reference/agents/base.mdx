The `Agent` class provides an easy-to-use interface to language models.

## Example

```python agent.py
from phi.agent import Agent

agent = Agent(description="You help people with their health and fitness goals.")

# -*- Print a response
agent.print_response('Share a quick healthy breakfast recipe.', markdown=True)

# -*- Get the response as a string
response = agent.run('Share a quick healthy breakfast recipe.', stream=False)

# -*- Get the response as a stream
response = ""
for delta in agent.run('Share a quick healthy breakfast recipe.'):
    response += delta
```
<Note>
  When no `model` is specified, the default of `OpenAIChat('gpt-4o')` is used.
