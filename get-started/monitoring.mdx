## Monitoring

Want to monitor and track your Agents?

Agno comes with built-in monitoring that will log session and performance metrics to [app.agno.com](https://app.agno.com). Set `monitoring=True` on any agent or set `AGNO_MONITOR=true` in your environment.

Create a file `monitoring.py` with the following code:

```python monitoring.py
from agno.agent import Agent

agent = Agent(markdown=True, monitoring=True)
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story")
```

Run the agent locally and view the session on [app.agno.com/sessions](https://app.agno.com/sessions)
