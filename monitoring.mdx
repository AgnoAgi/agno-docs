## Monitoring

You can set `monitoring=True` on any agent to log that agent's sessions or set `PHI_MONITORING=true` in your environment to log all agent sessions.

Create a file `monitoring.py` with the following code:

```python monitoring.py
from agno.agent import Agent

agent = Agent(markdown=True, monitoring=True)
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story")
```

Run the agent locally and view the session on [agno.app/sessions](https://www.agno.app/sessions)
