Agents come with built-in memory but it only lasts while the session is active. To continue conversations across sessions, we store Agent runs in a database like PostgreSQL.

Storage is a necessary component when building user facing AI products as any production application will require users to be able to "continue" their conversation with the AI.

The general syntax for adding storage to an Agent looks like:

```python storage.py
from phi.storage.agent.postgres import PgAgentStorage

# Create a storage backend using the Postgres database
storage = PgAgentStorage(
    # store runs in the ai.agent_runs table
    table_name="agent_runs",
    # db_url: Postgres database URL
    db_url=db_url,
)

# Add storage to the Agent
agent = Agent(storage=storage)
```

The following databases are supported as a storage backend:

- [PostgreSQL](/storage/postgres)
- [SingleStore](/storage/singlestore)
