Claude is a family of foundational AI models by Anthropic that can be used in a variety of applications.

## Authentication

Set your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment. You can get one [from Anthropic here](https://anthropic.com/).

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=***
```

```bash Windows
setx ANTHROPIC_API_KEY ***
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example

Use `Claude` with your `Agent`:

<CodeGroup>

```python assistant.py
"""Run `pip install yfinance` to install dependencies."""

from phi.agent import Agent, RunResponse  # noqa
from phi.model.anthropic import Claude
from phi.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"),
    tools=[YFinanceTools(stock_price=True)],
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True,
)

# Get the response in a variable
# run: RunResponse = agent.run("What is the stock price of NVDA and TSLA")
# print(run.content)

# Print the response in the terminal
agent.print_response("What is the stock price of NVDA and TSLA")

```

</CodeGroup>

## Params

<ResponseField name="name" type="str" default="Claude">
  The name identifier for the assistant.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="id" type="str" default="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620">
  The specific model ID used for generating responses.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="max_tokens" type="int" default="1024">
  The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="temperature" type="float">
  The sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 make
  the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 make it more focused and
  deterministic.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="stop_sequence" type="List[str]">
  A list of sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="top_p" type="float">
  Nucleus sampling parameter. The model considers the results of the tokens with
  top_p probability mass.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="top_k" type="int">
  The number of highest probability vocabulary tokens to keep for
  top-k-filtering.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="api_key" type="str">
  The API key for authenticating requests to the service.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="base_url" type="str">
  The base URL for making API requests to the service.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="anthropic_client" type="AnthropicClient">
  An instance of AnthropicClient provided for making API requests.
