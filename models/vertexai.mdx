title: Gemini - VertexAI
---

`VertexAI` is Google's cloud platform for building, training, and deploying machine learning models.

We recommend experimenting to find the best-suited model for your use-case. Here are some general recommendations:

- `gemini-1.5-flash` is good for most use-cases.
- `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` is their strongest model.

## Authentication

[Authenticate with Gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal)

## Example

Use `Gemini` with your `Agent`:

<CodeGroup>

```python agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from agno.models.vertexai import Gemini

agent = Agent(
    model=Gemini(id="gemini-1.5-flash"),
    markdown=True
)

# Print the response on the terminal
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story.")
```

</CodeGroup>

## Params

<Snippet file="model-vertexai-params.mdx" />

`Gemini` is a subclass of the [Model](/reference/models/model) class and has access to the same params.
