## What are Agents?

Agents are autonomous programs that use language models to achieve tasks. They solve problems by running tools, accessing knowledge and memory to improve responses.

Instead of a rigid binary definition, let's think of Agents in terms of agency and autonomy.

- **Level 0**: Agents with no tools (basic inference tasks).
- **Level 1**: Agents with tools for autonomous task execution.
- **Level 2**: Agents with knowledge, combining memory and reasoning.
- **Level 3**: Teams of agents collaborating on complex workflows.

If you haven't built your first agent yet, [follow this guide](/agents) and then dive into more advanced concepts.

## Example: Research Agent

Let's create a research agent that can search the web using DuckDuckGo, scrape the top links using Newspaper4k and write a research report for us. Ideally we'll use specialized tools (like Exa) but let's start with the free tools first.

<Note>
The description and instructions are converted to the system message and the input is passed as the user message. Set `debug_mode=True` to view logs behind the scenes.

  <Step title="Create Research Agent">
    Create a file `research_agent.py`

    from agno.tools.newspaper4k import Newspaper4kTools

    # Initialize the research agent with journalistic capabilities
    agent = Agent(
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
        tools=[DuckDuckGoTools(), Newspaper4kTools()],
