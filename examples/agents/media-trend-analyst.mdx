---

This example shows how to create an intelligent media trend analysis agent that provides
comprehensive insights into emerging trends across news and digital platforms. The agent combines
keyword analysis, pattern recognition, and data-driven insights to deliver actionable media reports.

Example prompts to try:
- "Analyze media trends for AI agents on verge.com, linkedin.com, and x.com"
- "Identify emerging trends in cryptocurrency coverage"
- "Provide a report on media patterns for climate change discussions"
- "Forecast future developments in the tech industry based on current media trends"
- "Analyze the growth rate of discussions around electric vehicles"
